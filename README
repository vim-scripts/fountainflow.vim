The command :FountainFlow (or :FF) converts properly configured Fountain screenplay files into HTML compatible with LibreOffice.

After conversion, tap <enter> and the HTML becomes a fully formatted screenplay in LibreOffice.

Finish by loading page styles from an included template, which will start proper page numbering on page 2 of the script, while skipping over a title page and optional synopsis.

Example output, Big Fish regenerated from sample Fountain file:

All Fountain syntax supported, with just one limitation on dual dialogue (one line of dialogue per character). See http://fountain.io/syntax
